FITNESS STUDIO WEB APPLICATION Abstract: In the current fitness and health management landscape, there is a lack of a comprehensive platform that seamlessly integrates the roles of customers, trainers, and doctors. Customers face challenges in creating accounts, selecting suitable trainers, and tracking their progress. Trainers and doctors, on the other hand, lack efficient tools to monitor and communicate with their clients. The absence of a unified platform hinders effective communication and progress tracking, leading to sub-optimal health and fitness outcomes. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing an integrated platform with distinct modules for users, trainers, and doctors, facilitated by an admin. • The platform facilitates the sharing of knowledge and updates through blogs posted by trainers and doctors, and monthly fitness updates sent to customers. • The admin module has the authority to manage all operations, authenticate login credentials, and validate the data posted on the site, including blogs related to fitness and medical nutrition. • Customers can create accounts, choose classes, trainers, and doctors, subscribe to premium services, receive monthly fitness updates, and have a personalized dashboard for progress tracking and subscription management. • Customers have the option to subscribe to premium services for enhanced features and benefits.
